### 1. Cosmology - Wikipedia
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology)
Cosmology (from Ancient Greek κόσμος (cosmos) ' the universe, the world ' and λογία (logia) ' study of ') is a branch of physics and metaphysics dealing with the nature of the universe, the cosmos.

Definition & history References By Ailsa Harvey, Nola Taylor Tillman published February 21, 2022 Cosmology is a branch of astronomy involving the science of the universe's origin. (Image credit: Getty Images) Jump to: * History of cosmology & astronomy * Cosmological missions & instruments * Common cosmological questions * Additional resources * Bibliography Cosmology is a branch of astronomy that involves the origin and evolution of the universe, from the Big Bang to today and on into the future. According to NASA, the definition of cosmology is "the scientific study of the large scale properties of the universe as a whole." Cosmologists puzzle over exotic concepts like string theory, dark matter and dark energy and whether there is one universe or many (sometimes called the multiverse). While other aspects astronomy deal with individual objects and phenomena or collections of objects, cosmology spans the entire universe from birth to death, with a wealth of mysteries at every stage.

### 3. What is Cosmology? An Introduction to the Study of the Universe
[https://astronomyexplained.com/what-is-cosmology-an-introduction-to-the-study-of-the-universe/](https://astronomyexplained.com/what-is-cosmology-an-introduction-to-the-study-of-the-universe/)
This field of study is known as cosmology. In this article, we’ll take a deep look at cosmology, explain what is cosmology, and provide you with an introduction to the study of the universe. Cosmology is the study of our universe with scientific approaches, including its origin, structure, and evolution. It is a field that combines principles from physics, astronomy, mathematics, and philosophy to understand the fundamental nature of the cosmos. Instead, it focuses on understanding the universe as a unified system, investigating its overall properties, dynamics, and interactions.

(more) See all videos for this article cosmology, field of study that brings together the natural sciences, particularly astronomy and physics, in a joint effort to understand the physical universe as a unified whole. The branch of learning that deals with phenomena at the scale of many millions of light-years is called cosmology—a term derived from combining two Greek words, kosmos, meaning “order,” “harmony,” and “the world,” and logos, signifying “word” or “discourse.” Cosmology is, in effect, the study of the universe at large. On cosmological scales, galaxies (or, at least, clusters of galaxies) appear to be racing away from one another with the apparent velocity of recession being linearly proportional to the distance of the object. This relation is known as the Hubble law (after its discoverer, the American astronomer Edwin Powell Hubble). Interpreted in the simplest fashion, the Hubble law implies that 13.8 billion years ago all of the matter in the universe was closely packed together in an incredibly dense state and that everything then exploded in a “big bang,” the signature of the explosion being written eventually in the galaxies of stars that formed out of the expanding debris of matter.
