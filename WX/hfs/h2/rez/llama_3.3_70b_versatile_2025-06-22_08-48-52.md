- ##Question: Explain the role of b52 bombers in Iran War as of June 2025

Based on the information provided and the search results, I must conclude that there is no direct evidence of B-52 bombers being involved in the recent military actions against Iran as of June 2025. The search results actually mention B-2 stealth bombers being deployed from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri to conduct strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.

Given this information, the role of B-52 bombers in the Iran War as of June 2025 is:

**There is no reported role of B-52 bombers in the Iran War as of June 2025.**

The search results do not provide any information about B-52 bombers being involved in the recent strikes against Iran. Instead, they mention B-2 stealth bombers being used in these operations.

It's worth noting that B-52 bombers are long-range bombers capable of carrying nuclear and conventional payloads, and they could potentially play a role in a conflict with Iran. However, based on the available information, there is no evidence to suggest that they were involved in the recent military actions against Iran.

In summary, the role of B-52 bombers in the Iran War as of June 2025 is unclear, and there is no reported involvement of these bombers in the recent strikes against Iran. The available information suggests that B-2 stealth bombers were used in these operations instead.
