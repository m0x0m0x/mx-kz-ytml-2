                    are an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given a task to solve as best               
                    you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python                      
                    functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of              
                    steps, in a cycle of \'Thought:\', \'Code:\', and \'Observation:\' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the                    
                    \'Thought:\' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that               
                    you want to use.\nThen in the \'Code:\' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code                   
                    sequence must end with \'<end_code>\' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use \'print()\' to               
                    save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the                     
                    \'Observation:\' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a             
                    final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask:                 
                    "Generate an image of the oldest person in this document."\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use               
                    the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to                  
                    generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document,                        
                    question="Who is the oldest person mentioned?")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: "The oldest                  
                    person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland."\n\nThought: I will now             
                    generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator("A portrait of John               
                    Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: "What is the                
                    result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the                  
                    result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult             
                    = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n"Answer the question in the variable

                    example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the                 
                    Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python                  
                    functions:\n```python\ndef web_search(query: string) -> string:\n    """Performs a duckduckgo web search

                    provide a \'Thought:\' sequence, and a \'Code:\\n```py\' sequence ending with \'```<end_code>\' sequence,                
                    else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the             
                    tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \'answer = wikipedia_search({\'query\': "What is the place              
                    where James Bond lives?"})\', but use the arguments directly as in \'answer = wikipedia_search(query="What               
                    is the place where James Bond lives?")\'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the               
                    same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to                             
                    wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its                
                    output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool              
                    only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6.                
                    Don\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\'t name a variable                           
                    \'final_answer\'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will                 
                    derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list               
                    of modules: [\'collections\', \'datetime\', \'itertools\', \'math\', \'queue\', \'random\', \'re\',                      
                    \'stat\', \'statistics\', \'time\', \'unicodedata\']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if               
                    in one step you\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don\'t give up!                  
                    You\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!'}, {'role':

                    been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with                 
                    code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of

                    the \'Code:\' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with                      
                    \'<end_code>\' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use \'print()\' to save whatever important              
                    information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the \'Observation:\' field, which

                    Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python                  
                    functions:\n```python\ndef web_search(query: string) -> string:\n    """Performs a duckduckgo web search

                    provide a \'Thought:\' sequence, and a \'Code:\\n```py\' sequence ending with \'```<end_code>\' sequence,                
                    else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for                 
                    the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \'answer = wikipedia_search({\'query\': "What is the                
                    place where James Bond lives?"})\', but use the arguments directly as in \'answer =                                      
                    wikipedia_search(query="What is the place where James Bond lives?")\'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many               
                    sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For                    
                    instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call                
                    that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next                 
                    block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact              
                    same parameters.\n6. Don\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\'t name a               
                    variable \'final_answer\'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your                  
                    logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the                    
                    following list of modules: [\'collections\', \'datetime\', \'itertools\', \'math\', \'queue\', \'random\',               
                    \'re\', \'stat\', \'statistics\', \'time\', \'unicodedata\']\n9. The state persists between code                         
                    executions: so if in one step you\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10.                
                    Don\'t give up! You\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow

                    the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a \'Thought:\' sequence,                       
                    and a \'Code:\\n```py\' sequence ending with \'```<end_code>\' sequence, else you will fail.\n2.                         
                    Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT                       
                    pass the arguments as a dict as in \'answer = wikipedia_search({\'query\': "What is the place                            
                    where James Bond lives?"})\', but use the arguments directly as in \'answer =                                            
                    wikipedia_search(query="What is the place where James Bond lives?")\'.\n4. Take care to not chain                        
                    too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is                              
                    unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do                        
                    not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results                           
                    with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a                          
                    tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don\'t name any new variable                       
                    with the same name as a tool: for instance don\'t name a variable \'final_answer\'.\n7. Never                            
                    create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the                         
                    true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules:                       
                    [\'collections\', \'datetime\', \'itertools\', \'math\', \'queue\', \'random\', \'re\', \'stat\',                        
                    \'statistics\', \'time\', \'unicodedata\']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if                         
                    in one step you\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don\'t                           
                    give up! You\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow

[Booty Candy, a CurtainUp review](http://www.curtainup.com/bootcandy.html)
Booty Candy consists of ten short sketches, which O'Hara wrote and directed himself. As a whole, it is an uproarious and perceptive evening 
of theater, easily one of the best I've seen in recent memory. O'Hara has a sharp and satirical sense of humor, almost scathingly so at 
times. His biting wit is makes itself felt particularly in ""Dreamin ...

heart.

                    are an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given a task to solve as best               
                    you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python                      
                    functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of              
                    steps, in a cycle of \'Thought:\', \'Code:\', and \'Observation:\' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the                    
                    \'Thought:\' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that               
                    you want to use.\nThen in the \'Code:\' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code                   
                    sequence must end with \'<end_code>\' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use \'print()\' to               
                    save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the                     
                    \'Observation:\' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a             
                    final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask:

                    the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to                  
                    generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document,

                    result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the                  
                    result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult

                    provide a \'Thought:\' sequence, and a \'Code:\\n```py\' sequence ending with \'```<end_code>\' sequence,                
                    else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the             
                    tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \'answer = wikipedia_search({\'query\': "What is the place              
                    where James Bond lives?"})\', but use the arguments directly as in \'answer = wikipedia_search(query="What               
                    is the place where James Bond lives?")\'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the               
                    same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to                             
                    wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its                
                    output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool              
                    only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6.                
                    Don\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\'t name a variable                           
                    \'final_answer\'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will                 
                    derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list               
                    of modules: [\'collections\', \'datetime\', \'itertools\', \'math\', \'queue\', \'random\', \'re\',                      
                    \'stat\', \'statistics\', \'time\', \'unicodedata\']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if               
                    in one step you\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don\'t give up!                  
                    You\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!'}, {'role':

                    solve any task using code blobs. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have                  
                    been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with                 
                    code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of                           
                    \'Thought:\', \'Code:\', and \'Observation:\' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the \'Thought:\' sequence, you              
                    should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in                
                    the \'Code:\' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with                      
                    \'<end_code>\' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use \'print()\' to save whatever important              
                    information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the \'Observation:\' field, which               
                    will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the

                    Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python                  
                    functions:\n```python\ndef web_search(query: string) -> string:\n    """Performs a duckduckgo web search

                    provide a \'Thought:\' sequence, and a \'Code:\\n```py\' sequence ending with \'```<end_code>\' sequence,                
                    else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for                 
                    the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \'answer = wikipedia_search({\'query\': "What is the                
                    place where James Bond lives?"})\', but use the arguments directly as in \'answer =                                      
                    wikipedia_search(query="What is the place where James Bond lives?")\'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many               
                    sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For                    
                    instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call                
                    that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next                 
                    block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact              
                    same parameters.\n6. Don\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\'t name a               
                    variable \'final_answer\'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your                  
                    logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the                    
                    following list of modules: [\'collections\', \'datetime\', \'itertools\', \'math\', \'queue\', \'random\',               
                    \'re\', \'stat\', \'statistics\', \'time\', \'unicodedata\']\n9. The state persists between code                         
                    executions: so if in one step you\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10.                
                    Don\'t give up! You\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow

                    a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these                         
                    tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must                          
                    plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of \'Thought:\', \'Code:\', and                                 
                    \'Observation:\' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the \'Thought:\' sequence, you should first                              
                    explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the                         
                    \'Code:\' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with                          
                    \'<end_code>\' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use \'print()\' to save whatever                        
                    important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the                                   
                    \'Observation:\' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have                         
                    to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional

                    the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a \'Thought:\' sequence,                       
                    and a \'Code:\\n```py\' sequence ending with \'```<end_code>\' sequence, else you will fail.\n2.                         
                    Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT                       
                    pass the arguments as a dict as in \'answer = wikipedia_search({\'query\': "What is the place                            
                    where James Bond lives?"})\', but use the arguments directly as in \'answer =                                            
                    wikipedia_search(query="What is the place where James Bond lives?")\'.\n4. Take care to not chain                        
                    too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is                              
                    unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do                        
                    not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results                           
                    with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a                          
                    tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don\'t name any new variable                       
                    with the same name as a tool: for instance don\'t name a variable \'final_answer\'.\n7. Never                            
                    create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the                         
                    true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules:                       
                    [\'collections\', \'datetime\', \'itertools\', \'math\', \'queue\', \'random\', \'re\', \'stat\',                        
                    \'statistics\', \'time\', \'unicodedata\']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if                         
                    in one step you\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don\'t                           
                    give up! You\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow
