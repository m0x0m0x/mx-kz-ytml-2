## Content
As of June 2025, the situation between Iran and Israel has escalated significantly beyond the long-standing proxy conflict, with direct military confrontations occurring. While not a formally declared war in the traditional sense, the level of direct exchange of strikes is being described as a "war" by various sources.

Key points of the Iran-Israel conflict as of June 2025 include:

*   **Direct Military Engagements:** The conflict has moved from a "shadow war" involving proxies to direct exchanges of missile and drone attacks between Iran and Israel. This escalation became particularly pronounced in 2024 and has continued into June 2025.
*   **Israeli Strikes on Iran:** Israel has conducted large-scale attacks on Iranian territory, targeting military capabilities, including missile production sites and air defense systems, as well as nuclear facilities. These strikes have reportedly aimed to set back Iran's nuclear program and have also resulted in the deaths of Iranian military leaders and nuclear scientists. Israel has achieved a degree of air superiority over Iran, allowing its air force to strike various targets.
*   **Iranian Retaliation:** Iran has responded to Israeli attacks by launching ballistic missile and drone barrages against Israel. These attacks have targeted military and security installations, as well as civilian areas, including cities like Tel Aviv, Haifa, and Beersheba. While Iran claims precise hits, its missile attacks have shown limited accuracy, and many have been intercepted by Israel's defense systems.
*   **Weakening of Iranian Proxies:** A significant factor in the escalation to direct conflict is the weakening of Iran's regional "Axis of Resistance" proxies, such as Hamas and Hezbollah, following conflicts with Israel. The collapse of the Assad regime in Syria in late 2024 has also reduced Iran's influence and provided Israel with greater freedom of aerial movement. While still capable of some actions, the proxies appear less able or willing to significantly support Iran in this direct confrontation. The Houthis in Yemen continue to pose a threat to shipping in the Red Sea, linked to the broader regional tensions, although there are reports of a ceasefire agreement with the US and a reduction in attacks on non-Israeli linked vessels since late 2024.
*   **Impact on Nuclear Program:** Israel's strikes have specifically targeted Iranian nuclear facilities, aiming to disrupt or delay Iran's nuclear program, which Israel views as an existential threat. The extent of the damage and how quickly Iran could recover or resume enrichment activities is a key question.
*   **International Involvement and Concerns:** The escalation has drawn international attention, with calls for de-escalation and diplomatic efforts. The United States has been involved, with reports of considering joining Israeli strikes and prior negotiations with Iran regarding its nuclear program. Other countries have also been involved in efforts to protect shipping in the Red Sea. There are concerns about the potential for the conflict to widen and its impact on regional stability and global trade.
*   **Humanitarian Impact:** The conflict has had significant humanitarian consequences, with civilian casualties and displacement reported in Iran, as well as in neighboring areas affected by the broader regional instability linked to the conflict, such as Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria.
*   **Political Dimensions:** The conflict is also viewed through the lens of the domestic political situations in both Iran and Israel.

In summary, as of June 2025, the Iran-Israel conflict is characterized by direct and increasingly intense military exchanges, a shift from the previous reliance on proxy warfare, and significant Israeli efforts to degrade Iran's military and nuclear capabilities. The conflict's trajectory and potential for further escalation remain key concerns for the region and the international community.
